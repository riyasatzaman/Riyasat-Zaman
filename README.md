<h1> RIYASAT ZAMAN <h/>

👋 Hello there! I'm Riyasat, a passionate and motivated third-year computer science student at the University of Alberta. 🎓

👨‍💻 I love diving into the world of code and exploring the endless possibilities it offers. My journey began when I first started coding in high school, and I've been captivated ever since. 💻

💡 From writing my first "Hello, World!" program to tackling complex algorithms and data structures, I'm constantly seeking new challenges to expand my knowledge and skills. I believe that continuous learning is the key to staying relevant in this ever-evolving industry. 

🌐 My interests lie in web development, software engineering, and artificial intelligence. I'm fascinated by the potential of these domains to reshape industries and improve the lives of people around the world. I'm always on the lookout for opportunities to contribute to open-source projects and learn from experienced developers. 💡

🌟 Feel free to reach out to me for discussions, project ideas, or anything related to technology. Let's connect and collaborate!
